<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

Companies worldwide communicate constantly with their clients to solve problems involving their products. After a while, some patterns will begin to emerge.
Customer service managers looking to efficiently use their agents' time efficiently will compile a list of Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) and post it on their website. 
They will then have this as a first level of support before the more complex queries can be shifted to a human agent. However, it doesn’t always work out that way. Why:

If you have many products or a big FAQ, no one will take the time to comb through it to find the specific question related to their issue.
People like it when they talk to others or feel like they have talked to others. Enter Large Language Models (LLMs). This project seeks to leverage the power of LLMs
to produce human-like natural responses to questions by fine-tuning an LLM using proprietary data so that it can chat with customers and handle their most frequent queries.
Customers can interact with the model via chat, type their questions and have them answered immediately. This system will be a huge time and resource saver for companies.
